1) Gather the data for training by executing following command - "python collectdata.py" , webcam window will open , in blue window make appropriate sign and then press character associated with it on keyboard 
this will record image , number of key presses = number of images recorded 
2) Then run "python data.py" to convert images to numpy array 
3) Then run "python trainmodel.py" to train the model on numpy array 
4) At last execute "python app.py" , then a webcam window will open and in which you can show the sign and get prediction by model

Note : "functions.py" contain functions needed to process images
